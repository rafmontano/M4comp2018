#' @rdname M4

#'

#'
#' @format M4 is a list of 100000 series.
#' Each series within \code{M4} is an object with the following structure:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{st}{Series number and period. For example "Y1" denotes first yearly series,
#'   "Q20" denotes 20th quarterly series and so on.}
#'   \item{n}{The number of observations in the time series}
#'   \item{h}{The number of required forecasts}
#'   \item{period}{Interval of the time series.
#'             Possible values are "Yearly", "Quarterly", "Monthly", "Weekly",
#'              "Daily" & "Hourly".}
#'   \item{type}{The type of series.
#'             Possible values are "Demographic", "Finance", "Industry", "Macro",
#'             "Micro" & "Other".}
#'   \item{x}{A time series of length \code{n} (the historical data)}
#'   \item{xx}{A time series of length \code{h} (the future data)}
#'   \item{pt_ff}{A 25xh matrix with the top 25 submissions to the M4 Competition, one on each row.
#'    Information can be found in the \code{submission_info} data.frame included in the package.
#'    Includes some benchmark methods such as Theta of ARIMA.
#'    The order of the rows is the rank in competition, e.g. best method is in row 1.}
#'    \item{up_ff}{A matrix containing the upper bound for the prediction intervals of the submissions.
#'                The row are ordered is the same as in \code{pt_ff}, not by their prediction interval performance.
#'                Partipants that submitted point forecasts but not prediction intervals have NAs in their row.}
#'    \item{low_ff}{A matrix similar to \code{up_ff} but with the lower bounds of the prediction intervals.}
#'    
#' }
#'
#'@note Series start is provided in year format for Yearly, Monthly and Quarterly series.
#' For Daily and Hourly series, it is given in the number of days after 1970-01-01 and for Weekly data
#' it is given in number of weeks since 1970-01-01.

#' Normalized M4 Dataset
#'
#' This dataset contains the normalized version of the M4 dataset.
#' If not found, it is automatically created using min-max scaling.
#'
#' @rdname M4_norm
#' @docType data
#'
#' @usage data(M4_norm)
#'
#' @format M4_norm is a list of 100000 series, where all numeric values have been min-max scaled.
#' Each series within \code{M4_norm} retains the same structure as \code{M4}, with scaled values:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{x}{A normalized time series of length \code{n} (the historical data, scaled between 0 and 1)}
#'   \item{xx}{A normalized time series of length \code{h} (the future data, scaled between 0 and 1)}
#'   \item{pt_ff}{A 25xh matrix of min-max scaled forecasts from the top 25 submissions in the M4 Competition.}
#'   \item{up_ff}{A min-max scaled matrix containing the upper bound of the prediction intervals.}
#'   \item{low_ff}{A min-max scaled matrix containing the lower bound of the prediction intervals.}
#' }
#'
#' @note The normalization uses min-max scaling independently for each time series.
#' The original minimum and maximum values are stored to allow inverse transformation.
