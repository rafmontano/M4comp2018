\title{M4 Competition data}
\format{M4 is a list of 100000 series.
Each series within \code{M4} is an object with the following structure:
\describe{
  \item{st}{Series number and period. For example "Y1" denotes first yearly series,
  "Q20" denotes 20th quarterly series and so on.}
  \item{n}{The number of observations in the time series}
  \item{h}{The number of required forecasts}
  \item{period}{Interval of the time series.
            Possible values are "Yearly", "Quarterly", "Monthly", "Weekly",
             "Daily" & "Hourly".}
  \item{type}{The type of series.
            Possible values are "Demographic", "Finance", "Industry", "Macro",
            "Micro" & "Other".}
  \item{x}{A time series of length \code{n} (the historical data)}
  \item{xx}{A time series of length \code{h} (the future data)}
  \item{pt_ff}{A 25xh matrix with the top 25 submissions to the M4 Competition, one on each row.
   Information can be found in the \code{submission_info} data.frame included in the package.
   Includes some benchmark methods such as Theta of ARIMA.
   The order of the rows is the rank in competition, e.g. best method is in row 1.}
   \item{up_ff}{A matrix containing the upper bound for the prediction intervals of the submissions.
               The row are ordered is the same as in \code{pt_ff}, not by their prediction interval performance.
               Partipants that submitted point forecasts but not prediction intervals have NAs in their row.}
   \item{low_ff}{A matrix similar to \code{up_ff} but with the lower bounds of the prediction intervals.}

Featuring 100000 time series from different domains

The 100000 time series from the M4-competition. Includes the submitted forecasts (https://www.m4.unic.ac.cy/)

\note{
Series start is provided in year format for Yearly, Monthly and Quarterly series.
For Daily and Hourly series, it is given in the number of days after 1970-01-01 and for Weekly data
it is given in number of weeks since 1970-01-01.
